	  <p>Sample answer:
	  <br> Digitisation is the process of converting information into a digital format. Hence, when talking about the digitisation of graphical data you are talking about converting an array of bits into a digital image. This is done through bit mapping or memory mapping which is the relationship between the image on a screen and the bits stored in primary/secondary memory. One or more bits must be stored for each pixel drawn in an image where each dot on a screen is representative of a pixel.The more pixels that can be displayed by a screen, the better the image quality will be. Images are usually stored in .jpg or .png files. Similarly, the the digitisation of audio refers to how sound and other analog data generally represented as a transverse wave can be converted to digital form by a process called sampling. Sampling is comprised of sampling size which refers to the number of bits used to store each sample from the analog wave and sampling rate which is the number of samples or slices taken of the analog wave in 1 second. The most common ausio file types include .wav or .mp3 files.
