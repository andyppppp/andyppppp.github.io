      <p>From question 4, analyse your chosen advancement and its potential ethical considerations this technology will bring. Analyse the ethical impacts on society and the industry/people who develop multimedia systems.</p>

      <p>One ethical issue people disregard when thinking about the cloud is that of the environment. In 2007 there was a study shown that the ICT industry produces 2% of all global carbon dioxide missions, which is equal to that of the aviation industry. Especially, now due to COVID19 and exponentially increasing rates of computer and technological advancement since the study was made in 2007, the ICT industry would be expected to have more effect on the environment. When taking cloud computing into account, data centres, the places and facilities that store data for the cloud, are not measured by how much terrabytes of data they can store but rather by their electrical capacity as data centres solely rely on how much power they can get from the grid as storage servers are not the main cost in their business structures. Because data centres use so much power and electricity, questions can be raised how the electricity is produced, whether it is clean and renewable or unrenewable power. With the increase in data centres across the world, it can be expected that environmental standards will drop as more power must be produced and whether it is of a good or bad source all electrical power solutions have some form of harm to the environment and inherently affect society and how we function. Society, hence, needs to consider the effect that data centres have on the environemnt we live in and must weigh the positives and negatives of cloud computing and a worsening environment that we live amongst. Another ethical issue related to cloud computing that effects the nature of work for the multimedia system industry is security and whether it will be safer to store their assets locally in their own system's secondary storage or on the cloud. As mentione previously, most multimedia systems and website hold and store some form of personal information for their users which can range from email adresses to passwords to credit card details. The industry itself has to evaluate whether it is safer to store their data externally in data centres such as Amazons' or with their own hard drives and forms of secondary storage. In addition, the use of the cloud allows for new avenues for hackers as the cloud needs internet for the transfer of data. Therefore, dat whilst being transmitted over the internet can be intercepted and stolen or manipulated by malicious means. This would be extremely risky depending on the data that is sent over the internet. Hence, people involved with multimedia systems must determine whether the benefits of using the cloud outweigh the risk of a data leak or a hacker stealing many peoples' personal information. Therefore, the cloud poses an ethical issue of the environmental damage to society and the ethical issue of security to the multimedia industry.</p>
