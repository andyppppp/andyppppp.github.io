	  <p>Sample answer:
	  <br> A number of different skills are required for the development of a good multimedia applicationand each represenst its own area of expertise. The first field of expertise is content provision which describes how content providers ensure the technical accuracy of an application as they are experts in the subject matter of the application they are aiming to develop. The second is system design and project management which describes how system designers and project managers are responsible for the overall design, development, completion of the multimedia system they aim to produce. These people require leadership skillsas well as technical knowledge about the development of such systems. The third are of expertise ids the collection and editting of media types. Depending on the intended delivery medium such as CD or over the Internet, collectors and editors are responsible for the media that will be put into the multimedia application. In some cases these people will need to consider issues such as bandwith and data transfer requirements, screen resolution and memory and processor demands to ensure the chosen media mode is sufficient to meet the applications's purpose. The fourth field of expertise is design and layout skills as tey are required to ensure that the presentation of the application, screen layout, keyboard commands, flow of information and other such areas prodce an ergonomically sound interactive application which meets its design goals. The fifth and final field of expertise is technical skills in information technology as it is required to support developers and users of a computer system with questions relating to hardware and software maintenance, usage and repair and so on. In terms of the devlopment of the multiimedia application, such skills would involve selecting, installing and configuring appropriate and effecient hardware and software combinations.
