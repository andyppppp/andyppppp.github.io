      <p>For the multimedia system Lynda, list 2 people (their roles) that would be involved in: 
		<br>a.	the creation of the system (1 person) 
		<br>b.	its continuing operation (1 person)

      <p>Two people that are involved in the creation of the system and the continuation of the system include a software developer and the content creators. The role of a software developer is researching, designing, implementing and managing software programs. In this case the software developer would have to specialise in html and be able to effectively write and script the Lynda.com website and any other internal and external software applications used in the company. Most likely this would be the job of a whole team of software engineers. These coders would also have to test and evaluate new programs and technologies that could aid and benefit their website and also identify areas for modification in the Lynda.com website and subsequently develop these modifications. Therefore, the role of a software devloper during the creation of the Lynda.com system is to essentially write and implement effecient code. The role of the content creators, the experts in software, creative and business skills, is to continuusly film and crate videos for the subscribers of the system. This would mean that they would need to plan, film and edit videos regularly in order for the continuous operation of Lynda.com. Without the content creators making tutorials and educational videos the whole premise of Lynda.com would be undermined and subscriptions would cease and their brand name would be tarnished. Because of this it is vital that content creators continuously create videos for the website for the website to stay profitable and running.</p>
