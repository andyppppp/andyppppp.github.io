      <p>The Oculus Rift is possible of doing many things and the first is that of educating people. Education in terms of the Oculus Rift is very easy to do. The Oculus Rift could be used for students to explore and learn from different virtual environemnts such as as a coral reef for students studying marine biology or a prehistoric jurassic era world for students studying archaeology or prehistoric dinosaurs and flora and fauna. Students can learn from and gain knowledge from interactions in virtual worlds programmed and designed by experts in certain fields. This is already evident with many apps and games already with the educational "tag" applied to them on the Oculus Rift website with apps and games called "Ocean Rift", "Chernobyl VR Project" and "Discovering Space". There are a plentitude more and they all aim to teach users through virtual environments, tasks, objectives and audio voice overs that all assist and teach the user along their virtual journey. The Oculus Rift can easily be distributed amongst students in schools, universities, colleges or workshops and could act as a way for students to do something practical whilst virtual through simulations of something like metal working or wood working. This could provide a safe, harm free environment for people to learn. The Oculus can also be used to help students read and visualise books that are prescribed to them in a similar fashion to audio books. VR can be used to give the readers/listeners something to watch as well. The Oculus can also be used to help students learn different languages through interacting with virtual peoples that speak different languages such as German, French or Chinese. The possibilities are endless when it comes to education. However, there are a few issues with using the Oculus Rift as a means for education and that being the nature of work for teachers. If the Oculus were to become widespread, many teaching roles would become redundant or the workload would be lowered and because of that teachers would predictably make less money as they are required to do less. The quality of teachers could worsen as teachers become reliant on Oculus Rift apps and games for their students and similar to the dilemna with Lynda.com, what if the information displayed in an Oculus Rift app is incorrect or biased. The Oculus Rift is also quite an expensive piece of tech and requires a computer to operate too and large areas of space with little to no obstacles to truly interact with the virtual environmnets. Many schools and educational institutions do not have these kinds of luxuries and it will be quite rare to find schools adopting the Oculus anytime soon due to the financial obligation the Oculus poses. Therefore, for the Oculus to be truly integrated into education there must be a slow and gradual fuse into school life with the preference that the Oculus Rift is used for personal use by individual students in the safety of their own home. This realistic approach would of course not truly change the nature of education as we know it today but there is no doubt that the Oculus or other forms of VR will be used to educate people in the future. Another thing that VR can influence is medicine. The Oculus Rift has been and could have the potential to help patients that are recovering from a range of physical and mental illnesses that modern medicine and practices are ineffective at solving. For example, people suffering from recently breaking their leg or an issue with walking could start out exploring a virtual world under guidanace from nurses and other experts. This would prove to be much more stimulating and engaging than that of walking on a treadmill or in a bland room and could act as an incentive for the patient to recover faster. Another application for VR is that of giving people, as stated before a form of brain stimulation, after potential problems with their brain. In addition to this, people suffering from mental illnesses could also utlisise the Oculus Rift as an escape from their reality and could replace the role of drugs or other harmful substances or actions that many mentally ill people use as a form of escapism. VR could also be used to simulate how people react in certain situations and could be used to study people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder when put into different scenarios with predetermined tests done on them in safe, supervised environments. Therefore, VR and the Oculus Rift could have a place in the future in the realms of medicine. However, there are issues again placed around the nature of work with people in the medical industry. The Oculus Rift could again make jobs redundant or worsen the qualities of therapists and doctors and nurses as they become reliant on using VR rather than undergoing proper tested practices. Similiarly, some practioners could abuse VR and use it as a money making opportunity, claiming that they have found the best new therapy and make lots of money prescribing medical solutions that have not been tested and proven to work. This is similar to the issue with antidepressant pills as there are many studies showing that they have no real impact on reducing people with depression and in the same light psychologists just may resort to letting people escape their fears through VR rather than actually finding solutions to their patient's problems. VR is also quite new and in comparison to many of the medicines and practices of today that have been tested and refined over decades, VR would be seen as experimental in the time being and probably is not suitable until further research and tests have been made to show that VR is viable in the future. Finally, the last topic VR and the Oculus Rift could affect is that of politics. VR like any other from of technology will eventually be used to influence politics. Whether it be from giving users a virtual tour of the White House or a simple tour of a city with posters of Donald Trump or Joe Biden there will always be room for political bias in any app. In addition, political parties can even adopt VR and create their own virtual environments where they explain their policies or give a vision of their uptopian world under thier political system or party. VR has the power to influence politics in so many ways. The issue with this is, is it ethical? It is right to influence users to vote a certain way in an up coming election or to influence users for an up coming referendum. Imagine if the Liberal party got caught influencing Oculus Rift users to vote no for the gay marriage referendum by paying the designers and creators of Oculus Rift programs to put "Vote No" propaganda in their virtual environments. Similarly, if the Labour party got caught doing the same thing but by saying "Vote Yes" there would be adverse social backlash and ramifications. However, like every other form of technology; televisions, phones, computers and much more, they have all been politicised and it is inevitable that the Oculus will be too one day. As the Oculus grows traction and popularity, more and more younger audiences will be exposed to political bias and it will be up to which ever political party or political view gets to to VR first to determine how younger people think for the coming future. Therefore, VR can be used in the future for educational, medicinal and political reasons but will all have their share of issues and flaws.</p>
